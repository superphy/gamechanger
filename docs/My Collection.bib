abstract = {1.We present an R package, ggtree, which provides programmable visualization and annotation of phylogenetic trees.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n2.ggtree can read more tree file formats than other software; including newick, nexus, NHX, phylip and jplace formats and supports visualization of phylo, multiPhylo, phylo4, phylo4d, obkData and phyloseq tree objects defined in other R packages. It can also extract the tree/branch/node-specific and other data from the analysis outputs of BEAST, EPA, HYPHY, PAML, PHYLODOG, pplacer, r8s, RAxML and RevBayes software, and allows using these data to annotate the tree.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n3.The package allows coloring and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a selected portion.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n4.A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heatmap), multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n5.The package ggtree is released under the Artistic-2.0 License. The source code and documents are freely available through Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ggtree).},
