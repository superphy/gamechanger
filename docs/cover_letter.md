Dear Editor,

Please find attached our manuscript, "Pan-genome analyses of the species Salmonella enterica, and identification of genomic markers predictive for species, subspecies, and serovar" by Chad R Laing, Matthew D Whiteside, and Victor PJ Gannon. 

We believe out manuscript aligns well with the aims of the Frontiers in Microbiology special issue, as we present original research that could have potential down-stream implications in culture independent-detection, epidemiological surveillance, food safety, and pathogenic assessment of the food-borne pathogen, Salmonella enterica.

In this original research, we analyze and identify the pan-genome of nearly 5000 Salmonella enterica whole-genome sequences, and identify species- and sub-species specific genomic markers, and identify markers predictive of sub-groups, such as serotype. 

Further, all aspects of the analyses, manuscript and data are fully open access and hosted on a publicly accessible GitHub account, with all public genomes referenced via their accession numbers. Thank you for taking the time to consider our manuscript, and we look forward to your evaluation.

Sincerely,

The Authors
